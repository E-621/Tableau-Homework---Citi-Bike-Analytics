# Tableau-Homework---Citi-Bike-Analytics
# CitiBike Covid Participation

Initially, I had set out to research citibike data pre, during, and post Covid for the month of June. It appears that they changed their data set, so I could not compile all the data I wished to research. I was able to review the June data for the years 2019 & 2020. I used Jupyter Notebook to import and combine data from 2019 & 2020. I then converted the gender column from 0,1 & 2 to unknown, male and female. After loading the data into tableau, I made the following discoveries.

It appears that the user age data is flawed, or New York should now top the list of the world's oldest, healthiest people.

The data indicates that users are entering an age that isn't quite possible, or they are entering an age that they find humorous (reference the year 1969).

The data suggest that users born before 1990 declined during Covid, and users born in 1990 or beyond increased during covid. This could indicate that older users were being more cautious about the disease and that the illness's consequences less influenced younger users.

Users subscribing to the citibike serve decreased during Covid, suggesting that users believed this to be a short-lived phenomenon.
